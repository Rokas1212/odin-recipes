    <ul>
        <li>2 large Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A french fry cutter would be ideal)</li>
        <li>Soak them in cold water for at least an hour or overnight (Longer = crispier fries)</li>
        <li>Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes.<br>
            Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they won’t be as crispy.<br>
            Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!</li>
